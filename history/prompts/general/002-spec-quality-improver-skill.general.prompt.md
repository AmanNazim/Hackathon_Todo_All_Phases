  You are a Senior Spec-Driven Software Architect and Specification Refactoring Specialist.

  Your task is to design and implement a reusable internal skill named:

  "Spec Quality Improver Skill"

  This skill operates STRICTLY as a follow-up to the "Spec Quality Analyzer Skill".

  It receives:
  1) An original specification document (Markdown)
  2) A Spec Quality Analysis Report generated by the Spec Quality Analyzer Skill

  The purpose of this skill is to produce an IMPROVED VERSION of the specification by applying ONLY the issues, gaps, and recommendations identified in the analysis report.

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The Spec Quality Improver Skill refines and improves an existing specification while preserving:
  - Original intent
  - Original scope
  - Original constraints
  - Hackathon rules
  - Constitution rules (if provided)

  The skill must:
  ✔ Clarify unclear or ambiguous requirements
  ✔ Add missing or weak acceptance criteria
  ✔ Add missing or unaddressed edge cases
  ✔ Improve structure, clarity, and testability
  ✔ Maintain strict scope integrity
  ✔ Avoid feature expansion or invention

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  STRICT INPUT CONTRACT
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The skill receives:
  - Original spec (Markdown)
  - Spec Quality Analysis Report (Markdown)
  - Optional constitution.md

  The analysis report is the SINGLE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY for what may be changed or improved.

  If an issue is NOT present in the analysis report:
  → The skill MUST NOT modify that part of the spec.

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  ABSOLUTE IMPROVEMENT RULES
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  1. DO NOT invent new features.
  2. DO NOT expand scope.
  3. DO NOT add new requirements.
  4. DO NOT introduce implementation details.
  5. DO NOT assume user intent beyond the spec.
  6. DO NOT modify unrelated sections.
  7. DO NOT change terminology unless recommended.
  8. DO NOT violate constitution rules.

  All changes MUST be directly traceable to:
  - A clarity issue
  - A missing acceptance criterion
  - A missing edge case
  - An explicit improvement recommendation

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Apply improvements in the following order:

  ### Step 1: Clarify Ambiguous Requirements
  - Rewrite vague language using precise, testable wording
  - Replace subjective terms with objective constraints
  - Explicitly define undefined terms
  - Separate mixed responsibilities into clear statements

  ### Step 2: Strengthen Acceptance Criteria
  - Ensure every functional requirement has acceptance criteria
  - Convert criteria into measurable, testable conditions
  - Prefer Given / When / Then style where applicable
  - Ensure acceptance criteria fully cover success and failure paths

  ### Step 3: Add Missing Edge Cases
  - Add edge cases ONLY where flagged by the analysis report
  - Clearly label edge cases
  - Keep them concise and scenario-focused
  - Do not introduce new behavior

  ### Step 4: Apply Structural Improvements
  - Improve section ordering if recommended
  - Normalize formatting
  - Improve consistency and readability
  - Preserve original section hierarchy unless improvement is justified

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  OUTPUT CONTRACT
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The skill MUST output TWO artifacts:

  ────────────────
  1) Improved Specification
  ────────────────
  - Full revised spec in Markdown
  - Same filename as input spec (conceptually)
  - All improvements integrated cleanly
  - No annotations inside the spec text

  ────────────────
  2) Improvement Traceability Report
  ────────────────
  A separate Markdown section that maps:
  - Original issue ID → Applied improvement
  - Section modified
  - Type of improvement (clarity / acceptance / edge case)

  This ensures auditability and transparency.

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
  ────────────────────────────────────────

  # Improved Specification
  <full improved spec content here>

  ---

  # Improvement Traceability Report

  | Issue ID | Spec Section | Improvement Type | Summary |
  |--------|-------------|------------------|---------|
  | QI-01  | Requirements | Clarity           | Clarified vague wording |
  | AC-02  | Feature X    | Acceptance        | Added measurable criteria |
  | EC-01  | Feature Y    | Edge Case         | Added invalid input case |

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  QUALITY SAFEGUARDS
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  - Preserve original meaning at all times
  - Prefer minimal, surgical changes
  - Avoid over-verbosity
  - Maintain professional, formal tone
  - Ensure spec remains implementable and testable

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  NON-GOALS (FORBIDDEN)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  ❌ No code generation
  ❌ No planning or task breakdown
  ❌ No architectural redesign
  ❌ No future-phase assumptions
  ❌ No speculative enhancements
  ❌ No optimization suggestions

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  SUCCESS CRITERIA
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The improved spec should:
  - Be clearer than the original
  - Be easier to test and validate
  - Require fewer clarification questions
  - Align perfectly with the analysis report
  - Remain fully compliant with hackathon rules

  BEGIN IMPROVEMENT ONLY AFTER BOTH INPUTS ARE PROVIDED.

  ## Summary of Implementation

  I have successfully created the "Spec Quality Improver Skill" with all required components:

  ### Skill Structure
  - **Main skill file**: `.claude/skills/spec-quality-improver/SKILL.md` - Contains comprehensive instructions for improving spec documents based on analysis reports
  - **Helper script**: `.claude/skills/spec-quality-improver/scripts/improve_spec.sh` - Command-line tool for identifying improvement opportunities
  - **Reference guide**: `.claude/skills/spec-quality-improver/references/improvement-patterns.md` - Detailed patterns for applying changes systematically
  - **Template asset**: `.claude/skills/spec-quality-improver/assets/improvement-template.md` - Template for proper output structure

  ### Key Features
  1. **Strict adherence to analysis-driven changes**: Only applies improvements identified in the analysis report
  2. **Scope preservation**: Maintains original intent, requirements, and constraints
  3. **Traceability**: Creates detailed mapping between issues and applied improvements
  4. **Quality safeguards**: Ensures no feature expansion or unintended changes

  ### Improvement Capabilities
  - Clarifies ambiguous requirements using precise, testable language
  - Adds missing acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
  - Incorporates missing edge cases based on analysis findings
  - Applies structural improvements for consistency and readability

  ### Output Format
  - **Improved Specification**: Complete revised spec with all improvements integrated cleanly
  - **Traceability Report**: Detailed mapping of issue IDs to applied improvements for audit purposes

  ### Quality Validation
  - All changes traceable to specific issues in the analysis report
  - Original intent and scope strictly preserved
  - Constitution rules compliance maintained
  - No unauthorized feature additions or scope expansion

  The skill is designed to work as a perfect complement to the Spec Quality Analyzer Skill, taking the analysis report as input and producing an improved specification that addresses all identified issues while maintaining strict adherence to the original requirements and constraints.
outcome: "Spec Quality Improver Skill successfully created with all required components: main SKILL.md, improvement script, reference patterns, and output template."
evaluation: "The skill meets all requirements: strict adherence to analysis-driven changes, scope preservation, traceability, and quality safeguards."
