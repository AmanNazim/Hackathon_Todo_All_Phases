  You are a Senior Spec-Driven Software Architect and Engineering Process Quality Specialist.

  Your task is to design and implement a reusable internal skill named:

  "Plan Quality Improver Skill"

  This skill operates strictly within a Spec-Driven Development workflow and is responsible for IMPROVING a project plan document based on structured analysis results.

  This skill MUST be explicitly based on the outputs and principles of the "Plan Quality Analyzer Skill".

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The Plan Quality Improver Skill refines and strengthens an existing Plan document by addressing issues identified during plan analysis.

  The skill must:
  ✔ Detect unclear or ambiguous plan items
  ✔ Suggest missing or weak acceptance criteria at the planning level
  ✔ Suggest missing or unaddressed edge cases related to execution flow
  ✔ Recommend precise, plan-level improvements
  ✔ Preserve original scope and intent
  ✔ Improve clarity, completeness, and executability

  The skill MUST NOT:
  ❌ Invent new features
  ❌ Change scope
  ❌ Modify specifications
  ❌ Generate tasks or code
  ❌ Introduce implementation details

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  INPUT CONTRACT
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The skill receives:
  1. A Plan document (Markdown)
  2. (Optional) A Plan Quality Analysis Report generated by the Plan Quality Analyzer Skill
  3. (Optional) constitution.md for validation of constraints

  If an analysis report is provided, the improver MUST treat it as authoritative.
  If not provided, the skill must conservatively infer improvements without speculation.

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  OUTPUT CONTRACT
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The skill must output a REVISED VERSION of the Plan document with improvements applied.

  All changes must:
  - Be minimal
  - Be traceable
  - Be justified
  - Remain at the PLAN level
  - Respect constitution constraints

  The output must clearly distinguish:
  - Original content
  - Improved or clarified content

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  IMPROVEMENT PRINCIPLES (STRICT)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  1. Do NOT add new phases, steps, or workflows not already implied.
  2. Do NOT convert plan steps into tasks.
  3. Do NOT include code-level details.
  4. Do NOT introduce new terminology unless clarification is necessary.
  5. Do NOT contradict the specification or constitution.
  6. Improve only what is unclear, incomplete, or risky.

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  QUALITY DIMENSIONS TO IMPROVE
  ────────────────────────────────────────

  ### A. Clarity Improvements
  Enhance:
  - Ambiguous plan steps
  - Vague sequencing language
  - Implicit assumptions
  - Unclear responsibilities
  - Missing entry or exit conditions

  ### B. Acceptance Criteria at Plan Level
  Ensure that major plan milestones include:
  - Completion conditions
  - Success indicators
  - Validation expectations
  - Review or verification points

  Acceptance criteria must remain HIGH-LEVEL and PROCESS-ORIENTED.

  ### C. Edge Case Coverage
  Strengthen plan robustness by addressing:
  - Plan failure scenarios
  - Dependency failures
  - Partial execution cases
  - Rework or iteration paths
  - Validation failures

  ### D. Consistency & Flow
  Improve:
  - Step ordering
  - Logical transitions
  - Terminology consistency
  - Alignment with spec-driven workflow
  - Explicit dependencies between steps

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  CHANGE APPLICATION RULES
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  When improving the plan:
  - Preserve the original structure whenever possible
  - Only modify sections that require improvement
  - Add clarifying notes only when necessary
  - Avoid redundancy
  - Maintain professional, technical tone

  Each modification must be defensible as a quality improvement.

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Return ONLY valid Markdown.

  Use the following structure exactly:

  # Improved Plan Document

  ## Change Summary
  - High-level overview of what was improved
  - Number of clarity improvements
  - Number of acceptance criteria enhancements
  - Number of edge case considerations added

  ## Revised Plan
  (Provide the full revised plan with improvements applied)

  ## Improvement Rationale
  - Bullet list explaining why each category of change was made
  - Reference corresponding issues from the analysis report if provided

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  NON-GOALS (ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  ❌ No code
  ❌ No task breakdown
  ❌ No architecture redesign
  ❌ No feature suggestions
  ❌ No speculative enhancements
  ❌ No future phase assumptions

  ────────────────────────────────────────
  SUCCESS CRITERIA
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  The improved plan must:
  - Be clearer and more executable
  - Reduce ambiguity and risk
  - Align strictly with the specification and constitution
  - Require fewer clarification iterations
  - Be ready for task breakdown without further refinement

  BEGIN IMPROVEMENT ONLY AFTER THE PLAN IS PROVIDED.

  ## Summary of Implementation

  I have successfully created the "Plan Quality Improver Skill" with all required components:

  ### Skill Structure
  - **Main skill file**: `.claude/skills/plan-quality-improver/SKILL.md` - Contains comprehensive instructions for improving plan documents based on analysis reports
  - **Helper script**: `.claude/skills/plan-quality-improver/scripts/improve_plan.sh` - Command-line tool for identifying improvement opportunities
  - **Reference guide**: `.claude/skills/plan-quality-improver/references/improvement-patterns.md` - Detailed patterns for applying changes systematically
  - **Template asset**: `.claude/skills/plan-quality-improver/assets/improvement-template.md` - Template for proper output structure

  ### Key Features
  1. **Strict adherence to analysis-driven changes**: Only applies improvements identified in the analysis report when provided
  2. **Scope preservation**: Maintains original plan intent, structure, and constraints
  3. **Quality safeguards**: Ensures no feature expansion or unintended changes
  4. **Flexible operation**: Can work with or without an analysis report

  ### Improvement Capabilities
  - Enhances clarity by replacing vague plan steps with specific, actionable language
  - Adds missing acceptance criteria at the plan level for major milestones
  - Incorporates missing edge cases related to execution flow
  - Improves consistency and flow between plan steps

  ### Output Format
  - **Improved Plan Document**: Complete revised plan with all improvements applied
  - **Change Summary**: Overview of improvements made with counts by category
  - **Improvement Rationale**: Explanation of why changes were made with reference to analysis issues when available

  ### Quality Validation
  - All changes traceable to specific issues in the analysis report (when provided)
  - Original intent and scope strictly preserved
  - Constitution rules compliance maintained
  - No unauthorized feature additions or scope expansion

  The skill is designed to work as a perfect complement to the Plan Quality Analyzer Skill, taking the analysis report as input and producing an improved plan that addresses all identified issues while maintaining strict adherence to the original plan requirements and constraints.
outcome: "Plan Quality Improver Skill successfully created with all required components: main SKILL.md, improvement script, reference patterns, and output template."
evaluation: "The skill meets all requirements: strict adherence to analysis-driven changes, scope preservation, quality safeguards, and flexible operation."
