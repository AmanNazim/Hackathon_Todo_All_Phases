## Understanding Your Metrics

### Overview Dashboard

The overview dashboard provides a snapshot of your task management performance.

#### Key Metrics

**Total Tasks**
- The total number of tasks you've created
- Includes completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
- Excludes deleted tasks

**Completed Tasks**
- Number of tasks marked as "Done"
- Shows your overall accomplishment

**Pending Tasks**
- Tasks in "To Do" status
- Represents your current backlog

**In Progress Tasks**
- Tasks you're actively working on
- Helps track concurrent work

**Completion Rate**
- Percentage of tasks completed out of total active tasks
- Formula: `(Completed Tasks / Total Active Tasks) × 100`
- **Good**: 70%+ completion rate
- **Needs Improvement**: Below 50%

**Overdue Tasks**
- Tasks past their due date that aren't completed
- High numbers indicate scheduling or capacity issues

**Productivity Score**
- Overall score from 0-100 based on multiple factors
- Combines completion rate, adherence, velocity, and consistency
- **Excellent**: 80-100
- **Good**: 60-79
- **Fair**: 40-59
- **Needs Improvement**: Below 40

---

### Task Distribution

#### By Priority

See how your tasks are distributed across priority levels:

- **High Priority**: Urgent and important tasks
- **Medium Priority**: Important but not urgent
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have tasks

**Best Practices**:
- Keep high-priority tasks under 20% of total
- Focus on completing high-priority items first
- Don't let low-priority tasks accumulate

#### By Status

Understand your workflow distribution:

- **To Do**: Tasks not yet started
- **In Progress**: Tasks being worked on
- **Done**: Completed tasks

**Healthy Distribution**:
- To Do: 40-50%
- In Progress: 10-20%
- Done: 40-50%

**Warning Signs**:
- Too many "In Progress" tasks (>30%) suggests context switching
- Very few "Done" tasks suggests completion issues

---

### Trends Analysis

Track your performance over time to identify patterns and improvements.

#### Time Periods

Choose from three aggregation periods:

**Daily**
- Best for: Short-term tracking (1-2 weeks)
- Shows: Day-by-day variations
- Use when: Monitoring recent changes or new habits

**Weekly**
- Best for: Medium-term trends (1-3 months)
- Shows: Week-over-week patterns
- Use when: Identifying weekly productivity cycles

**Monthly**
- Best for: Long-term analysis (3-12 months)
- Shows: Month-over-month growth
- Use when: Evaluating quarterly or annual progress

#### Trend Indicators

**Tasks Created**
- How many new tasks you're adding
- Increasing trend: Growing workload or better task capture
- Decreasing trend: Lighter workload or task completion catching up

**Tasks Completed**
- Your completion velocity
- Increasing trend: Improving productivity
- Decreasing trend: May indicate burnout or capacity issues

**Completion Rate**
- Percentage of tasks completed over time
- Upward trend: Improving efficiency
- Downward trend: Backlog growing faster than completion

**Productivity Score**
- Overall performance trend
- Use to track long-term improvement
- Look for consistent upward movement

---

### Due Date Adherence

Measures how well you meet your deadlines.

#### Metrics Explained

**Adherence Rate**
- Percentage of tasks completed by their due date
- Formula: `(On-Time Tasks / Total Tasks with Due Dates) × 100`
- **Excellent**: 90%+ adherence
- **Good**: 75-89%
- **Needs Improvement**: Below 75%

**On-Time Tasks**
- Tasks completed before or on their due date
- Higher is better

**Late Tasks**
- Tasks completed after their due date
- Analyze patterns to improve planning

**Average Delay**
- Average number of days tasks are completed late
- Lower is better
- Use to adjust future estimates

#### Time Periods

- **30 Days**: Recent performance
- **90 Days**: Quarterly trends
- **Year**: Annual patterns

---

## Appendix: Metric Formulas

### Completion Rate
```
Completion Rate = (Completed Tasks / Total Active Tasks) × 100
where Total Active Tasks = Total Tasks - Deleted Tasks
```

### Adherence Rate
```
Adherence Rate = (On-Time Tasks / Tasks with Due Dates) × 100
where On-Time = Completed before or on due date
```

### Task Velocity
```
Task Velocity = Completed Tasks / Number of Weeks
```

### Productivity Score
```
Productivity Score = (
  Completion Rate × 0.30 +
  Adherence Rate × 0.30 +
  Normalized Velocity × 0.25 +
  Consistency Score × 0.15
)
```

### Average Completion Time
```
Average Completion Time = Sum(Completion Time) / Number of Completed Tasks
where Completion Time = Completed Date - Created Date
```

### Average Delay
```
Average Delay = Sum(Delay Days) / Number of Late Tasks
where Delay Days = Completed Date - Due Date (for late tasks only)
```
