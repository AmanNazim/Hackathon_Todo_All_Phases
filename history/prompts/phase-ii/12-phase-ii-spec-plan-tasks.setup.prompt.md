## Prompt

Created comprehensive specification, plan, and tasks documents for Phase II Full-Stack Web Application, detailing the transformation from CLI to web application with Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, and Neon PostgreSQL.

## Response snapshot

Completed the foundational documentation for Phase II development:
- Created detailed specification document outlining requirements and success criteria
- Developed comprehensive implementation plan covering architecture and key decisions
- Generated task breakdown for systematic implementation following spec-driven approach

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established clear roadmap for Phase II development with complete spec, plan, and tasks
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md for Phase II
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation of backend foundation, create development environment
- 🧠 Reflection: Following spec-driven development methodology ensures systematic progress toward defined goals

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start implementing backend foundation tasks
