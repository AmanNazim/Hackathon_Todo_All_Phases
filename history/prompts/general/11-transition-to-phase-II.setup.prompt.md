## Prompt

Started Phase II: Full-Stack Web Application development by creating initial directory structure, documentation, and configuration files.

## Response snapshot

Created the initial setup for Phase II of the Todo app evolution, transitioning from CLI to full-stack web application with Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, and Neon PostgreSQL.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundation for Phase II development with proper structure and documentation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created README.md, CLAUDE.md, and PHR for Phase II setup
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create Phase II specifications, implement backend API, develop frontend interface
- 🧠 Reflection: Following spec-driven approach ensures systematic development of complex features

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin spec-driven development for Phase II features
