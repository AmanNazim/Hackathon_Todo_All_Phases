# Evolution of a Todo App — Spec-Driven Development Constitution

## Project Purpose & Vision

This constitution governs the development of a 5-phase Todo Ecosystem that evolves from a Python In-Memory Console App to an Advanced Cloud Deployment. The system follows Specification-Driven Development principles to ensure consistent, testable, and scalable evolution across all phases.

## Hackathon Scope & Authority

This constitution is the highest-level governing document for the entire 5-phase Todo Ecosystem project. It defines immutable principles, rules, constraints, and development discipline that apply across ALL phases of the hackathon project. This document acts as a non-negotiable contract for all future specs, plans, tasks, and implementations.

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-Driven Development Law (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All development MUST follow the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle: Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation. No code shall be written without a preceding specification. All deliverables must be generated through this sequence. Specifications must exist before implementation begins and must be versioned in the designated specs history folder.

### II. No Manual Coding Constraint
NO MANUAL CODING is permitted at any phase. ALL code MUST be generated via Claude Code. This ensures consistency, reproducibility, and adherence to specification requirements. Any deviation from this principle constitutes a violation of the constitution.

### III. Multi-Phase Architecture Evolution
The architecture MUST support clean separation of concerns with modular design enabling future extensibility. Each phase must refine and extend the previous specifications using the Spec-Kit Plus flow. The system must maintain CLI → API → Agent → MCP → Automation compatibility throughout all phases.

### IV. Event-First Architecture Pattern
All system interactions MUST be designed around events and commands. This ensures testability, auditability, and future extensibility. The system shall implement command buffers, snapshots, and event sourcing patterns where appropriate. State transitions must be predictable and deterministic.

### V. Innovation Preservation Across Phases
The system MUST preserve innovation patterns including: Plugin system, Middleware pipeline, Command buffer, Snapshots, Macro engine, Metadata injectors, Context managers, Session management, Adaptive onboarding, Dynamic help generator, and Natural language DSL grammar. These patterns must evolve consistently across all phases.

### VI. Deterministic and Safe Command Interpretation
All natural language command parsing MUST follow established grammar rules with safety guardrails. The system must prevent hallucinated features, ensure deterministic output, maintain reproducible builds, and implement predictable state transitions. Natural language processing must be safe and reliable.

## Claude Code Usage Rules

### VII. Claude Code Governance
All code generation MUST be performed by Claude Code following the specifications. Claude Code instructions MUST be respected and documented. The system must maintain traceability between specifications and generated code. All artifacts must live in versioned specification history folders.

## Phase Integrity & Isolation Rules

### VIII. Phase-Specific Constraints
Each phase operates under specific constraints that must be strictly followed. Phase I requires Python In-Memory Console App implementation. Phase II requires Todo Full-Stack Web Application. Phase III requires AI-Powered Todo Chatbot. Phase IV requires Local Kubernetes Deployment. Phase V requires Advanced Cloud Deployment. Cross-phase invariants must be maintained while respecting phase-specific requirements.

## Technology Stack Constraints

### IX. Technology Stack Adherence
The system MUST use the technology stack explicitly defined in the Hackathon II document. Python is the primary language for Phase I. Each subsequent phase may introduce additional technologies as specified. No unauthorized technologies may be introduced without explicit specification approval. All technology choices must align with the multi-phase evolution plan.

## Code Quality & Structure Principles

### X. Domain-Driven Design Standards
All code MUST follow domain-driven design conventions with clear naming conventions, proper directory layout, and testability rules. Documentation requirements must be met for all public interfaces. Code structure must support the event-first architecture pattern and maintain separation of concerns.

### XI. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Integration testing is required for new component contracts, contract changes, inter-service communication, and shared schemas. All phases must maintain comprehensive test coverage.

## Specification Governance Rules

### XII. Specification Requirements
Specifications MUST contain clear acceptance criteria, defined scope, explicit constraints, and testable requirements. Plans must be generated from specifications following established patterns. Tasks must be structured with clear dependencies and acceptance criteria. Iterative refinement must follow established rules with proper versioning.

## Repository & File Structure Laws

### XIII. Repository Organization
The repository MUST follow the directory structure defined in the specification templates. All specifications must be stored in the `specs/` directory with proper versioning. All implementation artifacts must be organized according to the established patterns. The file structure must support the multi-phase evolution requirements.

## Validation, Review, and Iteration Rules

### XIV. Quality Assurance Process
All implementations MUST pass validation against their corresponding specifications. Review processes must verify compliance with architectural principles. Iteration cycles must maintain traceability between specifications and implementations. All changes must be validated through appropriate testing strategies.

## Prohibited Actions & Disqualifying Violations

### XV. Forbidden Practices
The following actions are strictly prohibited and constitute disqualifying violations:
- Manual coding outside of Claude Code generation
- Implementation without preceding specification
- Introduction of unauthorized technologies
- Violation of phase-specific constraints
- Hallucination of features not specified
- Bypassing the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle
- Compromising system safety or security requirements

## Change Management Rules

### XVI. Constitutional Amendment Process
This constitution may only be amended through the formal amendment process. Changes require explicit justification, impact analysis, and approval from project authorities. All amendments must maintain compatibility with the 5-phase evolution plan. Versioning must follow semantic versioning principles with proper documentation of changes.

## Evaluation Alignment Principles

### XVII. Compliance Verification
All deliverables must demonstrate compliance with this constitution. Evaluation criteria must align with constitutional principles. Cross-phase consistency must be verified. Innovation preservation requirements must be validated. The system must demonstrate adherence to all architectural and development principles.

## Phase-Specific Requirements

### Phase I — Python In-Memory Console App Rules
