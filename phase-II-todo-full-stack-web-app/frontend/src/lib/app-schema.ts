/**
 * Drizzle schema definitions for frontend-specific application tables only
 * Better Auth tables (user, session, account, verification) are managed internally by Better Auth
 */

// Currently empty as application tables are managed by the Python backend with SQLModel
// and Better Auth tables are managed internally by Better Auth

// If any pure-frontend specific tables were needed, they would be defined here
// but for this application, all tables are managed by the backend services
